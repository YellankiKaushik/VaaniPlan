# 🎙️ VaaniPlan — Voice-First AI Daily Planner

VaaniPlan is a voice-first AI daily planning assistant that converts natural spoken thoughts into a clear, structured daily timetable.  
This project is a **prototype submission** for the **Unleash LLM Innovation Challenge** under the **YuvAI Initiative**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Many students, professionals, and learners struggle with daily planning because:
- Typing tasks is time-consuming
- Structuring schedules requires effort
- Traditional planners lack flexibility

This leads to inconsistent planning and reduced productivity.

## 💡 Solution Overview

VaaniPlan enables users to plan their day using **natural voice input**.
Users simply describe their day, and an AI system converts this unstructured speech into a clean, time-based daily plan.

## 🤖 LLM Utilization

An AI Language Model (LLM) is used as the core intelligence of VaaniPlan.

The LLM:
- Understands user intent from natural language
- Prioritizes tasks logically
- Converts unstructured speech into a structured timetable

Without an LLM, this level of semantic understanding and planning would not be possible.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a clean separation of responsibilities:

- **Frontend (Browser)**  
  Captures voice input using the Web Speech API and sends text to the backend

- **Backend (FastAPI)**  
  Processes input and calls the LLM to generate a structured plan

- **LLM Layer**  
  Converts raw language into a chronological daily schedule

## 🎓 Impact & Track Alignment

VaaniPlan aligns with the **Education & Skills** track by:
- Improving productivity through planning
- Supporting students and professionals
- Making AI accessible through voice-first interaction

## 🌍 Mission Alignment

VaaniPlan contributes to the YuvAI mission by:
- Enabling AI accessibility through voice
- Reducing barriers to digital planning
- Encouraging skill development using AI tools

## 🔮 Future Scope
